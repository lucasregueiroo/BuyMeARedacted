## Buy Me A {Redacted}

I decided to make a Buy Me a Coffee website but since I don't drink coffee. Buy Me a {Redacted}
This was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that uses [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) for the wallet connection and [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) for the smart contract interaction.

All of the information submitted in the input boxes is stored on-chain.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
